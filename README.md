## Description

## Features

### User Management

- **Authorization and Authentication**: Implemented authentication and authorization functionalities for three user groups: **User**, **Operator**, and **Admin**. Each group has its own set of permissions.

### User Operations

- **Users**: Users can see their own profile information, edit their personal details, and change their password.
- **Operators**: Operators can see a list of all users, filter the users by their status (active or inactive), and view a user's profile. Operators cannot create, edit, or delete users. Additionally, operators can send an email to a user.

### Admin Panel

- **Manage Users**: Admins can perform CRUD operations on users. They can create new users, view a list of all users, filter the users by their status (active or inactive), and edit or deactivate a user.
